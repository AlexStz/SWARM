[93mCurrently Mining x17 x17 Algorithm[0m
SWARM is now benchmarking miners. It will only be able to 
properly calculate stats once miners finish benchmarking.

Note: Only one miner per algorithm and platform will show on stats 
screen. While benchmarking, miner will choose a miner that needs to be
benched, leaving previously benchmarked miners to vanish from stats 
screen. They will return if benchmarks were higher than current miner.

This is normal behavior.
