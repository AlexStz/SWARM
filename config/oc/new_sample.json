Notes On OC-Configuration:
Leave "Cards": ""  To not use OC tuning

For Cards:
Enter as shown below in "Cards" example
P-Model Cards Must Be Specified As Such:
P106-100
P106-090
P104-100
P102-100
If you require more p-model cards- Contact Developer.

"Cards": "1070 1050ti 1070 1050ti 1070 1050ti 1050ti 1050ti 1050ti 1070 1070 1050ti 1070",

If you are using windows version, and would like SWARM to start fans, enter
your fan speeds like thus. Cards Does NOT need to be specified to use. However
ALL fans the GPUS's SWARM is using must be set.

"windows fan start": "75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75",

"default_NVIDIA1":
{
 "Power": "150 150 150 150 150 150",
 "Core": "125 115 100 115 125 100",
 "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000"
},

This is the oc settings for NVIDIA1 devices group, which is based on
-Type NVIDIA1
-GPUDevices1

If was to have -GPUDevices1 set to:
-GPUDevices '0,2,4,9,10,12'

It follows in order of -GPUDevices, so in the above example:

-GPU 0 Core would be set to 125
-GPU 2 Core would be set to 115
-GPU 4 Core would be set to 100
-GPU 9 Core would be set to 115
-GPU 10 Core would be set to 125
-GPU 12 Core would be set to 100

If NO -GPUDevices were specifed, then ALL cards must be listed. Factory Settings is 0.
If you set Power for 1, you must set Power for all. You can leave Power blank, however.
Core and memory can be left blank as well.

"default_NVIDIA1":
{
 "Power": "75",
 "Core": "100",
 "Memory": "1000"
},

{
    "Cards": "1070 1050ti 1070 1050ti 1070 1050ti 1050ti 1050ti 1050ti 1070 1070 1050ti 1070",
    "windows fan start": "",
    "default_NVIDIA1":
     {
      "Power": "150 150 150 150 150 150",
      "Core": "125 125 125 125 125 125",
      "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000"
     },
     "default_NVIDIA2":
      {
       "Power": "75 75 75 75 75 75 75",
       "Core": "100 100 100 100 100 100 100",
       "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000"
      },
     "default_NVIDIA3":
      {
       "Power": "",
       "Core": "",
       "Memory": ""
      },
     "default_AMD1": 
     {
     "pl": "",
     "dpm": "",
     "v": "",
     "core": "",
     "mem": "",
     "mdpm": ""
     }   
 }

 These are the default settings for GPUs. They are not neccessary for SWARM.
 Default settings are used if you choose to set OC-Tuning for Algorithms,
 and no algorithms were specified. You must have default settings if you
 are using OC tuning in miner files!
