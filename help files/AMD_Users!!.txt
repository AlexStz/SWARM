Here are some pro-tips to getting SWARM to work:

-rocm-smi does not tell me if you have an integrated graphics card. Specify
 -OnboardCard Yes in arguments if you have one. This will tell SWARM to not
 add your Onboard Card to GPU table.

-SWARM is made to be used with hybrid platforms. Because of this, if you have
multiple platforms: -AMDPlatform argument must be used. Usually your 
opencl plaform is either 0 or 1.

-GPUDevices1 or others cannot apply to AMD. Half the miners cannot Specify
 individual devices. It's either all or nothing with SWARM.

-OC tuning- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! FOR HIGHLY EXPERIENCED USERS! I highly
 recommend increase your -Delay argument to a higher figure (5 to 10), or you will
 crash cards. Give the miner some time to set overclocking first. 
 OC voltage aggressively tunes voltage. I would not
 play with voltage unless you know what you are doing! AMD cards are extremely
 sensitive to overclocking. I cannot gurantee stability using the overclocking
 feature.

-Not all pools are fully compatible with AMD.

-Sgminer-KL is inside the "project" folder in miners. It is available for use,
 but does not work for a fair amount of cards from user reports. You can try
 it, and see if it works for you. If not, simply move it back into the project
 folder. To add it- Move file to "linux" folder.

-Some miners have no api. Some miners have to be launched only via a json and
 not arguments. I do the best I can to bring every potential hashpower to SWARM
 but a lot of it is expirmental in design.
